<p>In contemporary society, accessibility has transitioned from being a mere convenience to a
fundamental right, essential for individuals to lead fulfilling and independent lives. The World
Health Organization highlights that approximately 15% of the world's population lives with some
form of disability, with mobility impairment being particularly prevalent. In India, this translates
to over 3 crore individuals grappling with mobility challenges, a significant segment of the
population.
The inability to navigate stairs can significantly impede daily life activities and compromise
independence, affecting various demographics such as the elderly, individuals recovering from
injuries, and those with permanent disabilities. Recognizing this pressing need for accessible
solutions, this project endeavors to address the gap with a practical and cost-effective innovation:
a staircase lift for easy home access.
Conventional lifts, while offering a solution, often come with a hefty price tag and require
substantial installation space, rendering them impractical for many households, especially those
with limited budgets or space constraints. Our project aims to bridge this gap by proposing a
more economical alternative, the staircase lift. While the concept of a staircase lift isn't entirely
new, existing solutions often fall short in terms of affordability and adaptability.
We aim to build upon these existing foundations and innovate towards creating a solution that
not only addresses accessibility needs but does so in a financially feasible manner.</p>
